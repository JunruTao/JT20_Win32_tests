# JT20 Win32 tests
***
## 6/29/2020 Starting with Win32 API
Have tried different options creating a GUI for windows, now I found win32(Although very complicated) is very baisc and powerfull.
Having studied through few tutorials from youtube and udemy.com, now there are a very basic window application done from the scratch.
It was quite hard at the begining and I struggled with Unicode variable type such as `LPCWSTR` , `LRESULT`, however as long as being 
patient reading throught the Win32 API documents, it is very easy to get started with the code.
